Revamping of my final project - continuing to create and improve features --> WIP

I will be using machine learning to help combat housing instability and empower people with the data needed to engage their local and state reps to address these issues.


=========================================================================================

### TO DO:

1. Active features:
- find alternative (actively maintained) data sources than this:  https://uscensusbureau.github.io/citysdk/
- recheck US Census data options (what scale is most universal, which data points, accuracy?)
- find reliable real estate API options that use same scale as census data
- python and data processing/model training
- identifiers of issue --> actual def of issue and areas that have been identified with issue (model will look for these identifiers/patterns)

2. Possible additions:
- zoning laws and developer bids?
- local govt contacts and state rep contacts (api options?)

=========================================================================================

**Tech Used:  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Python**

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

## Usage

1. run `node server.js`
2. Navigate to `localhost:8080`

[//]: # (CURRENT TASK LIST AND IDEAS FOR PROJECT)

[//]: # (FINAL PROJECT - "GENTE AI" --> MACHINE LEARNING NOTES:)

[//]: # (TASK: CLASSIFICATION TASK)
[//]: # (will use decision tree to classify locations as gentrified or not)

[//]: # (DIMENSIONS: predictors/variables)
[//]: # (Ethnicity - shifts over time)
[//]: # (Average Income - over time)
[//]: # (Housing Prices)
[//]: # (Rental Prices)
[//]: # (Foreclosures)
[//]: # (Bankruptcies)

[//]: # (Training Model:)
[//]: # (Feed ai data about locations already identifed as gentrified)
[//]: # (See whether program can correctly id the location as gentrified or not based on data used)
[//]: # (Figure out which model performs best)
[//]: # (After ai starts working well --> figure out how to quantify data and visualize results for location)

[//]: # (Additional Features:)
[//]: # (if possible add development bidding info for areas --> make public aware of possible upcoming changes to neighborhoods)
[//]: # (add feature for users to contact their local and state reps --> form letter? phone numbers? emails? etc.)
[//]: # (have affordable housing and community orgs as resources for users to utilize if needed --> local food pantries, local activist groups, housing resources, groups and meetups, user inputs for local resources - after vetting? etc.)
[//]: # (have login so users can save the maps and data they request for future reference/use)
