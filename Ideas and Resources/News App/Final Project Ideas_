Final Project Ideas:

1. News Ranker:

Final project idea 1:
News Ranking app based on accuracy

Details:
I feel like I'm gonna have to make a web crawler that searches for pages named like "corrections" or "redactions" etc. And then I might have to manually look at the major media and social media influencer sites to create a database of which sites publish ads in the guise of articles and a list of sponsors - so people can see if their sponsors are influencing news stories

Initial Criteria: # of redactions/corrections per some time unit, is the redaction/correction info easily found on site, are ads clearly marked (no ads hidden as fake articles), list of sponsors + board of directors + etc.,  Archive of redacted stories is available, articles are fact based (no editorials passed along as objective articles, story quota per reporter (may give insight into quality of publications - if quota is too high, quality of articles may suffer), reporter pay, investigative journalism, articles about science/health/other studies emphasize the importance of independent peer review (1 new study coming out is meaningless until other studies can independently replicate its results).


Maybe criteria are broken down into categories:  
*Ranking (overall rating based on all criteria

*Accuracy score (based on # of redactions/corrections per some time unit

*Accessibility (is site easily accessed by all users and are the redactions/corrections and other disclaimer information clearly marked and easily found on site)

*Advertising (are ads clearly marked and kept separate from articles)

*Sponsors/Board/Mgmt (are owners and sponsors listed and disclosed openly to prevent influence over content of publications)

*Journalistic Integrity: do they have an investigative journalism department, and do they have a record of attempting to protect their sources effectively


*Scientific integrity: are science articles objective, clear, and clearly state that new studies need to be independently verified before being acted upon (do they provide a brief literature review to show if other studies have supported the conclusions/results in the past, do they also contrast with other studies that may contradict results?)

*Reporter workload: may give insight into quality of publications - if quota is too high, quality of articles may suffer
